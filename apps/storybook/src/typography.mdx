# Typography

We can use the `typography-{{variant}}` utility classes to apply the design
system typography to our components. For example, the `typography-d1` utility
class will apply the specifications seen bellow for the **Display 1** row. 

**P.S.**: We can see the full list of utility classes at the `index.css`
file.
